A very warm welcome to all those who are here!âœ¨ This Repository is made to ease the work of those coders who are working on tracking the COVID-19 spread.
This code helps you all in finding the spread of COVID-19 through a graph. This graph shows the Total no. of Covid-19 Patients, including No. of deaths, No. of recovered of each state and each country.


You can also get the code from below.
## Code
    import pycountry
    import plotly.express as px
    import pandas as pd

## ----------- Step 1 ------------

    URL_DATASET = r'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/master/data/countries-aggregated.csv'

      df1 = pd.read_csv(URL_DATASET)
      # print(df1.head) # Uncomment to see what the dataframe is like

## ---------- Step 2 ------------

    list_countries = df1['Country'].unique().tolist()

    # print(list_countries) # Uncomment to see list of countries

    d_country_code = {}  # To hold the country names and their ISO

     for country in list_countries:

    try:
        country_data = pycountry.countries.search_fuzzy(country)
        #country_data is a list of objects of class pycountry.db.Country
        #The first item  ie at index 0 of list is best fit
        #object of class Country have an alpha_3 attribute
        country_code = country_data[0].alpha_3 
        d_country_code.update({country: country_code})
    except:
    print('could not add ISO 3 code for ->', country)
        # If could not find country, make ISO code ' '
        d_country_code.update({country: ' '})
    # print(d_country_code) # Uncomment to check dictionary  

    # create a new column iso_alpha in the df
    # and fill it with appropriate iso 3 code
    for k, v in d_country_code.items():
    df1.loc[(df1.Country == k), 'iso_alpha'] = v    
    #print(df1.head)  # Uncomment to confirm that ISO codes added

## ---------- Step 3 ------------
    fig = px.choropleth(data_frame = df1,
                    locations= "iso_alpha",
                    color= "Confirmed",  # value in column 'Confirmed' determines color
                    hover_name= "Country",
                    color_continuous_scale= 'RdYlGn',  #  color scale red, yellow green
                    animation_frame= "Date")

     fig.show()
